# forge-api-demo

This is a simple demo of the Forge API by Nous Research. It demonstrates how to use the asynchronous API to trigger a reasoning completion and wait for the result.

If you want to jump straigt to the code, see: [src/forge-api-demo/cli.py](https://github.com/NousResearch/forge-api-demo/blob/main/src/forge-api-demo/cli.py).

## Setup

Install Poetry if you don’t have it:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Run

Here's how to run the command and see its help output:
```bash
> poetry run python src/forge-api-demo/cli.py -h
```

Which shows:
```
usage: forge-api-demo [-h] -p PROMPT [-r {fast,medium,slow}] [-t]

Simple demo of the Forge API by Nous Research. Run with env var FORGE_API_KEY set.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PROMPT, --prompt PROMPT
                        Your prompt.
  -r {fast,medium,slow}, --reasoning-speed {fast,medium,slow}
                        The reasoning preset to use: fast/medium/slow. Defaults to medium.
  -t, --track           Whether to return detailed information about the reasoning process.

For more information, see: https://forge-api.nousresearch.com/docs
```

Example completion run:

```bash
FORGE_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> poetry run python src/forge-api-demo/cli.py -p "How much wood would a theoretical 80kg woodchuck chuck assuming lunar gravity and a competitive woodchucking environment?"
```


## Example outputs

### Without tracking

If I want to ask:

> How much wood would a theoretical 80kg woodchuck chuck assuming lunar gravity and a competitive woodchucking environment?


I can run the command:

```bash
> FORGE_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> poetry run python src/forge-api-demo/cli.py -p "How much wood would a theoretical 80kg woodchuck chuck assuming lunar gravity and a competitive woodchucking environment?"
```

The output includes lots of metadata but the salient piece can be found under `result.choices[0].message.content`:

### With tracking

Tracking (`--track`) adds *very verbose* reasoning logs to the output.

```bash
> FORGE_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> poetry run python src/forge-api-demo/cli.py -p "How much wood would a theoretical 80kg woodchuck chuck assuming lunar gravity and a competitive woodchucking environment?" --track

Be wary of special characters in the JSON, as they may cause errors in parsing. Ensure that all special characters are escaped properly.\n6. For mathematical expressions or LaTeX in the problem description, always enclose them in quotes as strings.

If a value in the problem description contains any special characters, it should be enclosed in quotes as a string. This includes \"null\" and any math expressions.\n9. All explicit numerical values should be provided as numbers, not as strings.\n10. Set all variables to be used in the calculation to a defined numerical value, typically 0 for unknown values. Do not represent them as other variables or mathematical expressions.\n11. Your job is only to represent the initial state of the world, not to perform any calculations or solve the problem.\n12. Unknown values or variables mentioned in the problem should be initialized to 0, not left as strings or expressions.\n13.

Do not assume final values in the target_variables; use appropriate types or None if undetermined.\n4. Ensure all aspects of the problem are addressed in the conditions.\n5. Return the full lambda function as a string, including the 'lambda state:' part.\n6. Target variables should NOT include the exact answer to the question, as that will be discovered by the planner\n7. Remember, add the JSON object response inside <json> tags\n8. Do not include any Python code in the response, only the JSON object - it should be valid parseable JSON. So, values should be numbers, not strings, booleans should be lower case etc\n9. Do not make any calculations or assumptions in the conditions as they relate to the initial state or tasks. They should only be used for validation, such as ruling out negative values and checking that the variables used to track answer have some value provided\n10. Conditions should be checking for final results, not intermediate steps.\n11. Treat all given equations or scenarios equally - create a separate condition for each.\n12. Focus on verifying final results and problem constraints, not intermediate calculations.\n13. Avoid over-constraining the problem or trying to solve it within the conditions.\n14. For multi-step problems, create conditions that check the relationship between given and solved variables, not the calculation process.\n\nExample of a good condition:\n - \"lambda state: abs(state.variables['distance'] / state.variables['speed'] - state.variables['time']) < 0.01\"\n\nExample of a bad condition:\n - \"lambda state: state.variables['time'] == state.variables['distance'] / (state.variables['initial_speed'] + 2)\"\n\nRemember, the conditions are meant to verify a solution, not provide the solution itself.\n",

The woodchuck needs to chuck the wood at lunar escape velocity to be competitive. Lunar escape velocity is 2.38 km/s or 2380 m/s.\n\n2. The woodchuck can convert 10% of its body mass into kinetic energy to chuck the wood. \n\n3. The kinetic energy needed is 0.5 * mass * velocity^2. With the 80 kg woodchuck mass and lunar escape velocity, this works out to 1,799,712,000 Joules.\n\n4. With 10% of the woodchuck's mass, that's 8 kg of wood. Assuming a wood density of 500 kg/m^3, this means the woodchuck could theoretically chuck 0.016 m^3 or 16 liters of wood on the moon.\n\nThe code calculates these values and updates the state dictionary with the wood_chucked volume and sets problem_solved to True.\n</thinking>\n\nLet me know if you have any other feedback or if the problem is not fully solved!"

Don't try to answer the problem directly.\n\nPay careful attention to the feedback if it's provided, as it will be provided to you by the previous code execution. Correct any errors in the previous code before proceeding, rewrite the code entirely if necessary.\n\nFollow these additional guidelines:\n\n1. Start Simple: Begin with the most straightforward interpretation of the problem. If that doesn't work, gradually increase complexity.\n\n2. Show Your Work: Write out each step of the solution process in comments or docstrings. This makes it easier to catch and correct errors.\n\n3. Use Available Tools: Utilize libraries like SymPy for symbolic manipulation when dealing with algebraic equations. Import any necessary libraries at the beginning of your code.\n\n4. Handle Edge Cases: Consider and account for potential edge cases or special conditions in the problem.\n\n5. Explain Your Reasoning: At each significant step in your code, briefly explain why you're performing that operation using comments.\n\n6. Double-Check Units: Ensure that all calculations maintain consistent units throughout. Convert units if necessary.\n\n7. Generalize When Possible: Try to solve the problem in a way that could be applied to similar problems with different numbers.\n\n8. Set Up Equations: If the problem involves relationships between variables, set these up as equations first before attempting to solve.\n\n9. Solve Systems of Equations: If you have multiple equations with multiple unknowns, solve them simultaneously using appropriate methods.\n\n10. Verify Your Solution: After calculating the result, verify that it satisfies all conditions in the original problem.\n\n11. Don't guess at values unless it's stated in the task!\n\n12. Ensure that the variables assigned to the state object are regular Python types (e.g. int, float, str, list, dict, etc.) so they can be correctly serialised in the response.\n\nWork directly with the variables as they are named in the current state.\nYour code should update the state variables to meet all the goal conditions\nIf a target variable is not in the state, create it with the default value provided in the Target Variables section.\nAdd a 'problem_solved' variable that will be set to True if all conditions are met, False otherwise.\nThe program should be written in a way that it can be evaluated to obtain the answer, and wrapped inside <code> tags.\nThe problem should be represented entirely as a logic program, your task write a program that will solve the problem.\nThe solution to be problem should only be obtained by evaluating the code, and not by directly providing the answer in a variable.\nRepresent reasoning and logic as logical constraints in the code, that can then be evaluated to obtain the answer.\nDon't forget to escape string literals and other special characters in the code where required.\nAccess the state variables using state['variable_name']. That'll be the only way to access the state variables - don't invent new names for the state dictionary.\nInside the <code> tags, provide only the Python code, without any explanations or markdown formatting. Any comments should be in Python docstrings or comments.\nMake sure that all variables used have specific associated value clearly defined in the state.\nYou don't need to solve all the goal conditions, just any that are relevant to the current task.\n\nRemember to structure your solution following these steps:\n1. Read and understand the problem\n2. Define variables (using the provided state)\n3. Set up equations\n4. Solve the system of equations\n5. Calculate the required result\n6. Check your answer\n7. Express your answer by updating the state variables\n\nYour code should be clear, well-commented, and follow Python best practices.\n<important>\nIf you're given feedback on previous code, use it to fix or replace the previous code.
